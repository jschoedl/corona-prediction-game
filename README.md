## About
Users of this bot can predict the Covid-19 statistics by drawing a graph into a diagram. Afterwards, the number of cases is compared with the prediction and for every predicted day, up to 1 point can be scored.

This bot is using a dataset maintained by 'Our World in Data'. You can find it [here](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data). The original data is provided by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (EDCD).
